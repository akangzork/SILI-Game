# Milestone 2

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.
In this milestone, we ended up using unique pointers that allowed for our code to be shorter and cleaner, seeing as we cut off a couple of methods thanks to just being able to copy
memory addresses in different classes. We then used the graphics library to make our mouse or trackpad detect movement in our character by updating the screen each time we move a little bit.
## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.
A couple of challenges we encounterd while coding this milestone was how to implement the onmousevent and specially the filter intersections function in game.cc, we were struggling
to grasp the idea of a unique pointer to the project.
## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?
The most important thing we learned is the ability to create unqiue pointers and a hood amount of practice of looping through vectors correctly. This will be very useful in our
future coding endeavors.
